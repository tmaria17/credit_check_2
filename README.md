# Questions

1. What are you proud of?
That it's almost finished. I also think it works but it also may not. 
1. What do you need to improve?
I think I need to improve readability and I would go back and put all my methods in one method. 
flow control, single responsibility. 
1. What questions do you still have?
Are instance variables neccessary? If my test isn't passing but my method prints out the correct way in the actual file what should I do? Is it preferable to have all the methods in one method? I didn't do that but I tested it and it seemed to work fine without that. 
# Rubric

## Functionality 3

Notes:

- [x] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics 2

Notes:

The student(s):

- [ x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [ ] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [ ] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [ x] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [ ] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design 1

Notes:

The student(s):

- [ ] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [ ] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [ ] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [ x] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing 1

Notes:

The student(s):

- [x ] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [ ] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [ ] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [ ] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [ ] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control 1

Notes:

The student(s):

- [ x] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [ ] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [ ] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
